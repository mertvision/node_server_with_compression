# Compression

Compression is a process used to reduce the size of any data—such as a file—to smaller dimensions. Minimizing the size of data stored in any environment (like an operating system or a server) through compression algorithms can provide benefits depending on the context, such as saving storage space, reducing bandwidth usage, or enabling faster data transmission.
